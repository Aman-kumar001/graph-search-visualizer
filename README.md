# Algorithm Visualizer

This repository provides a visualization tool for various algorithms built using React.js and Material-UI. It allows you to visually understand how algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bubble sort, Selective sort, Heap sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, and Insertion sort work step by step.

## Installation

To use the algorithm visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aman-kumar001/graph-search-visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd graph-search-visualizer`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can select the algorithm you want to visualize from the available options. Each algorithm has its own interactive visualization.

The visualizations allow you to see the algorithm's progress in real-time, highlighting the data structures and operations involved. You can step through the algorithm's execution or let it run automatically.

## Used Libraries

The algorithm visualizer is built using the following libraries:

- React.js
- Material-UI

Material-UI provides a set of reusable UI components and styles that can enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the application.

## Supported Algorithms

The visualizer currently supports the following algorithms:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bubble Sort
- Selective Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort

## Contributing

Contributions to the algorithm visualizer are welcome! If you have any bug fixes, new features, or additional algorithms you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`
5. Create a pull request
